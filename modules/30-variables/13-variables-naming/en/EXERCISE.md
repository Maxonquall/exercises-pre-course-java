Create two variables with the names “first number” and “second number” using lowerCamelCase. Write in the first variable the number `1.10`, in the second - `-100`. Display the product of the numbers written in the resulting variables.

The code will work with any names, and our system always checks only the result on the screen, so the execution of this task is under your responsibility.
