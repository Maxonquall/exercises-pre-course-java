name: Comments
theory: |
  Almost all programming languages allow you to leave comments in code. They are not used by the code in any way and are needed only for people: for the programmer to leave notes for himself and for other programmers.

  Comments in Java are of three types:

  * **Single line comments** begin with `//`. Any text can follow these two characters, the entire line will not be parsed and executed.

      A comment can occupy the entire line:

      ```java
      // For Winterfell!
      ```

      Also, the comment can be on the line after some code:

      ```java
      System.out.println("I am the King"); // => For Lannisters!
      ```

  * *Multiline comments* start with `/*` and end with `*/`. It is customary to start each line with `*`, although this is not technically necessary:
      ```java
      /*
      * The night is dark and
      * full of terrors.
      */
      System.out.println("I am the King"); // => I am the King
      ```

  * **Documentary comments** start with `/**` and end with `*/`. It is already mandatory for them to start each line with `*`.
  
      Documenting comments are a subspecies of multiline comments. At the same time, they have an additional function - they can be collected with the help of a special javadoc utility and given as documentation for your code. We will talk about them later - when we will analyze classes and methods.
