Type the code from the job character to character in the editor and click “Validate”.

```java
class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

If you write *heLLo, woRld!* instead of *Hello, World!*, it will be considered different text because upper and lower case letters are different characters. Letter size is called *register*, and they say: **register is important!** This applies to almost everything in code, so get used to always paying attention to case.
